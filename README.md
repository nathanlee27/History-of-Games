# Welcome to our Website

This is our flask project where we have a website showing the history of popular games.

## How to navigate

There is a navigation bar at the top and you can click on them to go to different parts of our site to show the history of PacMan, Tetris, Mario, and Hangman


## File Descriptions

### General files

main.py - makes the website urls and it is the base of the website

data.py - where the lists are for each of our creators names and a little bit of what they have done for the project.

### Code files

home.html - The main area of our website is just a description of what our website is about.
